# Repository Guidelines

## Project Structure & Module Organization
- `src/`: Application code entry at `src/main.tsx`.
- `src/routes/`: Route components (TanStack Router). `__root.tsx` is the root, and `routeTree.gen.ts` is generated by the router plugin â€” do not edit manually.
- `src/components/`: Reusable UI organized by domain: `layout/`, `common/`, `table/`, `chart/`.
- `src/store/`: Global state (Zustand), e.g., `modalStore.ts`.
- `public/`: Static assets (SVGs, fonts, sample JSON). Served at site root.
- `index.html`, `vite.config.ts`: Vite configuration and HTML template.

## Build, Test, and Development Commands
- `npm install`: Install dependencies.
- `npm run dev`: Start Vite dev server with HMR.
- `npm run build`: Type-check (tsc) and build to `dist/`.
- `npm run preview`: Serve the production build locally.
- `npm run lint`: Run ESLint (configured to work with Prettier).

## Coding Style & Naming Conventions
- Language: TypeScript + React (Vite).
- Formatting: Use Prettier (2-space indent). Example: `npx prettier . --check`.
- Linting: ESLint with React Hooks and Prettier compatibility (`npm run lint`).
- Components: PascalCase file and export names (e.g., `TableCell.tsx`).
- Utilities/hooks: camelCase (e.g., `useSomething.ts`).
- Styles: Co-locate `.css` files with components (kebab-case filenames).

## Testing Guidelines
- No test runner is configured yet. If adding tests, prefer Vitest + React Testing Library.
- Place tests next to components as `Component.test.tsx` or under `src/__tests__/`.
- Keep tests deterministic (mock dates/data where needed).

## Commit & Pull Request Guidelines
- Commits: Imperative mood, concise subject (<50 chars), optional body with rationale and scope. Reference issues (e.g., `Fixes #123`).
- PRs: Describe what/why, link issues, include screenshots/GIFs for UI changes.
- Quality gates: `npm run lint` and `npm run build` must pass. Keep PRs focused and small.

## Security & Configuration Tips
- Do not commit secrets. Use Vite env vars prefixed `VITE_` (e.g., `.env.local`).
- Do not edit `src/routeTree.gen.ts` (auto-generated by TanStack Router plugin).
- Place large/immutable assets in `public/`; prefer SVGs for icons.
